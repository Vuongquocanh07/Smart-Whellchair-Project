# Smart-Wheelchair-Project

Traditional wheelchairs, while essential for mobility, are limited in functionality. They typically lack advanced features like health monitoring, environmental sensors, and enhanced safety capabilities, which can make it challenging for users to move independently and stay safe. A smart wheelchair, however, addresses these gaps, offering a more comprehensive solution to support users’ well-being and safety.

## Key Features

### 1. Health Monitoring
- Smart wheelchairs can track essential health metrics such as **heart rate** and **SpO₂** (blood oxygen levels).
- Additionally, they can monitor environmental conditions like **CO₂ levels**, **temperature**, and **humidity** to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for the user.

### 2. Collision Alert System
- Equipped with **ultrasonic sensors** on all four sides, a smart wheelchair can detect nearby obstacles, providing timely alerts to help the user avoid collisions and navigate safely.

### 3. GPS Tracking
- Real-time **GPS** allows family members to monitor the user’s location, adding a layer of security and reassurance for both users and their families.

### 4. WiFi Connectivity and Cloud Support
- A built-in processor enables **WiFi connectivity**, allowing the wheelchair to send health and location data to the cloud.
- Users and family members can access this data via **smartphone apps**, providing continuous insight into the user's safety and health.
